# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Bobby's boss wants to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, he also wants a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
### The following Retiring Titles table contains the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring.(employees who were born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955.)

Analyz the data a bit, we can conclud:

90,398 employees or 37.7% of the company's total current employees will be retiring soon.

Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer will be the most impacted positions with respectively 29,414, 28,254 and 14,222 futures retirees, which correspond to 12.3%, 11.8% and 5.92% of the company's workforce.

Only 2 Managers will be retiring soon. It seems that management renewal has been to focus of the company to the detriment of technical positions renewal.

### Mentorship Eligibility table was created and it holds all the current employees who were born between January 1st, 1965 and December 31st, 1965.

## Summary
90,398 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
There are 1,549 eligible mentors in the company. If we assume that they will all be willing to participate in the mentorship program, it will imply that each mentor would have an average of 58 mentees, so we can conclude that there is not enough mentors to prepare the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

The following tables give us the number of retirement-ready employees and the number of eligible mentors per department. It shows that all departments are lacking mentors.
